## Log

### Day 1: Monday, November 3

**Today's Progress**:
- Started working on [My Family Recipes](https://github.com/joleen-bothma/my-family-recipes): learning about HTML, CSS, 11ty, and JavaScript by building a website that shows my own family recipes. The goal will be to browse our favourite recipes with additional organisational elements like tags and categories.

### Day 2: Tuesday, November 4

**Today's Progress**:
- Started working on [My First Django App](https://github.com/joleen-bothma/django-polls): learning about backend web development with Django by following the offical tutorial.
- Downloaded and installed Postgresql to use with Django in later projects.

### Day 3: Wednesday, November 5

**Today's Progress**:
- Abandoned previous Django project (My First Django App) and started working on a ToDo App using a combination of 2 resources:

### Day 4: Thursday, November 6

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued working on my ToDo app
  - Encountered an issue when adding a view to create a new task: URL for `reverse_lazy` returns an error. I think I am running into problems because I am not using good naming conventions between my views, models, and url paths. Commited the code but need to fix this.
